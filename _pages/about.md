## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the [Medical Imaging Data and Analysis Lab (MIDAS.lab)](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/radiologie/allgemeine-radiologie/forschung/ag-midas) at the University Hospital Tübingen and the [Institute for Signal Processing and System Theory (ISS)](https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart.  
Recently, I was a visiting researcher at the [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging (AIMI)](https://aimi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, supported by the **Carl-Duisberg Fellowship** of Bayer AG.

My research focuses on developing **reliable and generalizable deep learning algorithms** for **medical image and text analysis**, with a particular interest in **causality**, **fairness**, and **domain generalization** in medical AI.  
I also teach the *Medical Image Analysis Lab* at the University of Stuttgart.

My work has been recognized with several awards, including the **Best Oral Presentation Award** at the *MICCAI FAIMI Workshop (2025)* and at the *Society for Magnetic Resonance Angiography Annual Meeting (2023)*.  
During my master’s studies, I received the **Carl Zeiss Women’s Award (1st Place, 2020)** and the **Women in STEM Fellowship** from *Festo AG & Co. KG (2017–2019)*.

I hold an **M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology** from the University of Stuttgart and a **B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Management** from the University of Applied Sciences Constance.
