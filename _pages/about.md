## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/radiologie/allgemeine-radiologie/forschung/ag-midas">Medical Imaging Data and Analysis Lab (MIDAS.lab)</a> at the University Hospital TÃ¼bingen and the 
<a href="https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute for Signal Processing and System Theory (ISS)</a> at the University of Stuttgart. 
Recently, I was a visiting researcher for six month at the <a href="https://aimi.stanford.edu/">Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging (AIMI)</a> at Stanford University.

My research focuses on developing reliable and generalizable deep learning algorithms for medical image and text analysis, with a particular interest in causality, fairness, and domain generalization in medical AI.  Besides research, I also teach the Medical Image Analysis Lab at the University of Stuttgart.

I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart and a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Management from the University of Applied Sciences Constance. 

Throughout my studies, I gained valuable international experience, including:  
- Semester abroad at **Edinburgh Napier University** in Scotland, UK (2016, undergraduate).
- Participation in the **International Leadership Development Program** at **Elizabethtown College** in Pennsylvania (USA)  (2014, undergraduate).
- **Global Teaching Lab** at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**  in USA (2019, graduate).
- **German-Sino Joint Class** at **Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)** in China  (2019, graduate).
- **Visiting Student Researcher** (6-months) at **Stanford University** in USA (2024, PhD program).
