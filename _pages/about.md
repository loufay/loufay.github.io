## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the [Medical Imaging Data and Analysis Lab (MIDAS.lab)](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/de/das-klinikum/einrichtungen/kliniken/radiologie/allgemeine-radiologie/forschung/ag-midas) at the University Hospital TÃ¼bingen and the [Institute for Signal Processing and System Theory (ISS)](https://www.iss.uni-stuttgart.de/) at the University of Stuttgart.  
Recently, I was a visiting researcher at the [Center for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging (AIMI)](https://aimi.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University

My research focuses on developing reliable and generalizable deep learning algorithms for medical image and text analysis, with a particular interest in causality, fairness, and domain generalization in medical AI.  Besides research, I also teach the Medical Image Analysis Lab at the University of Stuttgart.

I hold an M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart and a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Management from the University of Applied Sciences Constance. Throughout my studies, I gained valuable international experience, including a semester abroad at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, participation in the International Leadership Development Program with visits to Brussels and Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania (USA), the Global Teaching Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the German-Sino Joint Class at Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST) in China.
